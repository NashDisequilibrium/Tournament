Tournament using Swiss pairings

1. All of the operations that can be done within the SQL code are done that way as this speeds up the processes. 

2. tournament.sql includes the SQL information

3. Running tournament.sql will create the necessary tables

4. You should see that the table are "players", "matches" and "winners"

5. The python file that includes the code for this project is tournament.py

6. There is a file called tournamenttest.py that includes SQL schema for the tournament along with code for running tests

7. tournamenttest.py will delete relevant SQL data after running a relevant test so you do not need to do this manually. 

8. Go to the terminal and run python file tournamenttest.py

9. This will show the program tournament.py working with all of the test information

10. You can also enter new names etc ino the test file for further testing

11. The program is designed to be scalable so adding more names to the test file will be fine

12. There is no CSS, GUI etc for this program.
